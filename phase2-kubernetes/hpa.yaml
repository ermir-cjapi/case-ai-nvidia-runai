# Note: HPA with GPU is problematic!
# 
# Issues:
# 1. Each pod requests 1 full GPU
# 2. Can only scale to number of available GPUs
# 3. With 1 GPU, maxReplicas is effectively 1
# 4. CPU/memory metrics don't reflect GPU utilization
#
# This HPA is included for demonstration, but won't solve
# the GPU underutilization problem. See Phase 3 (Run:AI) for solution!
